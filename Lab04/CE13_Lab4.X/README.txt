>> Collaboration with others: NONE

1.) Synopsis:

>> We were to reinvent the original calculator which we created, but using RPN. This forced us
>> to learn and investigate the use and implementation of the stack, arrays as well as pointers
>> in order to properly have our program function. It also helped us practice good file and project
>> management, having to create separate test harnesses for each function, allowing to test things iteratively.
>> This lab was very informative in regards to structs and sub-members, manipulating values
>> and passing them by reference into other functions.

2.) Approach:

>> Unfortunately, I was unable to start the lab as early as I would have liked. Thus, 
>> after finally starting, I was a bit behind. It was difficult to get everything started.
>> However, after gathering everything I needed, the rest was fairly trivial. Except, 
>> my RPN.c had troubles with infinite looping and the tokenization of the strings.
>> It was a simple fix, but took me way longer than it should have to figure out.
>> The only thing I couldn't figure out in time was the Backspace_Evaluate() function.
>> I probably could have finished it given more time and effort. BUT, due to some
>> very unfortunate circumstances, I was unable to work on the lab over the weekend.
>> I'm not trying to make excuses, but I was completely out of commission due to 
>> an occular migraine. Anyways, other than that, things were pretty good.
>> The lab 

3.) Feedback:

>> In the end, the stack portion of the lab was very straight-forward. As for the RPN,
>> I had more troubles than I wanted. It was fun, difficult, interesting, and I believe
>> that I've learned alot regarding pointers and structs. The lab manual could have been
>> a bit more explicit in detailing how to go about certain parts of the lab.
>> Lectures were also very helpful; I like attending. Overall, I believe that I spent
>> at least a solid twenty-or-so hours on this lab, most attempting to debug.
>> Again, if I were to have had more time initially, I would have been better off.
>> Examples during class were very informative, more is always appreciated.
