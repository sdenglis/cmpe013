>> Collaboration with others: NONE

1.) Synopsis:

>> The lab was fairly straightforward. From my own perspective, 
>> I saw that the objective of the lab was to become comfortable 
>> with arrays, functions, as well as looping controls.
>> Each function was just another way to learn how to manipulate 
>> data within array structures. Very cool.

2.) Approach:

>> My approach, having some knowledge with respect to matrices, 
>> was to map out the different functions and how they could be 
>> implemented with logic. I believe that I jumped the gun,
>> and ended up biting off more than I could chew initially.
>> My workspace was very cluttered at first, which made it
>> much harder to iteratively test each matrix operation.

3.) Feedback:

>> Honestly, I'm loving the lab manuals. They are super helpful
>> when starting off with each project. I'd say that I'm a better
>> programmer after having finished this lab! Anyways, lectures are
>> also very nice. Only thing that seemed a bit iffy to me: the 
>> grading criteria. This lab is interesting because a good portion
>> of it has to be graded subjectively by the TA's.
