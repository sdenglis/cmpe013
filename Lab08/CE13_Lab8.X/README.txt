>> No collaboration occured for this lab.

1.) Summary:

>> From what I have gathered, this lab was a test in our abilities to put together
>> all of the information we've attained thus far in regards to structs, ISR's, 
>> event handling, switch cases as well as finite state machines. Recursion was
>> really only a small part in the greater field of vision covered by this
>> project. I thought that the lab manual actually uneccessarily (and misleadingly)
>> focused heavily on the BinaryTreePrint and Create functions. In reality, or
>> at least from my own experience, the brunt of my issues stemmed from my implementation
>> of the MorseDecode and MorseCheckEvents functions. These had no direction given, 
>> little to no pseudo code in order to keep us on track. I had to really think
>> about what it was supposed to accomplish as a part of the greater lab (granted,
>> it is healthy to struggle and find solutions on our own.) It was, in my opinion,
>> not needed. It would've been very useful if, in the comments for these functions, 
>> it would have mentioned that we needed to utilize our GetLeftChild() and GetRightChild()
>> functions by passing the morseNode through them, and setting a temp node equal to that, etc.

2.) Approach:

>> Last weekend, I was quite lazy and dreading starting another project. But,
>> I managed to get over my daunting procrastinative habits and sit myself down
>> to write a fair chunk of code on Sunday. After achieving what I saw as 'enough,'
>> I held on until Tuesday's lecture to get a feel for the parts which I was missing.
>> At this point, I was sure of what I had to do and how to do it; I set off to 
>> finish the rest of my project this evening, on Tuesday. At this point, I've gotten
>> everything done and am proud. Although, I feel that I could have started earlier 
>> during the weekend, as it would have alleviated much of the stress felt during this
>> current week. I'll definitely plan on completing the battle boats lab sooner rather
>> than later.

3.) Results:

>> In the end, the lab ended up pretty fabulous. I've learned a lot about code
>> practice, implementations of recursive functions and have built even more
>> knowledge for that which I've already been exposed to. My project compiles
>> completely: each test_harness.c functions correctly. I know for a fact that
>> the individual functions are in working order. As for the Lab08.main,
>> as far as I can tell, its functionality is as per the lab manual's standards.
>> I think that its incredibly amazing that at this point, we are able to build
>> a program that can literally decode an incoming string of morse code.
>> I would have never thought of accomplishing anything close to this before
>> taking this course; I'm loving learning more and more CS/E concepts. It's great.
>> As a final note, I would like to reiterate the need for more explanation in 
>> regards to the Morse.c section of the lab. There was a lack of emphasis on it
>> within the lab manual, and an overemphasis on the BinaryTree.c.
