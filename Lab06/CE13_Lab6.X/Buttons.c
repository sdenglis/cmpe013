/**
 * ButtonsCheckEvents function checks the current button states and returns
 *  any events that have occured since its last
 * call.  This function should be called repeatedly in a Timer ISR, though it can
 * be called in main() during testing.
 *
 * In normal use, this function should only be used after ButtonsInit().
 * 
 * This function should assume that the buttons start in an off state with 
 * value 0. Therefore if no buttons are
 * pressed when ButtonsCheckEvents() is first called, 
 * BUTTONS_EVENT_NONE should be returned. 
 * 
 * @return  Each bit of the return value corresponds to one ButtonEvent flag,
 *          as described in Buttons.h.  If no events are detected, BUTTONS_EVENT_NONE is returned.
 * 
 * Note that more than one event can occur simultaneously, though this situation is rare.
 * To handle this, the output should be a bitwise OR of all applicable event flags. 
 * For example, if button 1 was released at the same time that button 2 was pressed,
 * this function should return (BUTTON_EVENT_1UP | BUTTON_EVENT_2DOWN)
