>> No collaboration occured for this lab.

>> NOTE: One comment I have would be, unfortunately, the lack of feedback.
>> As far as I am aware, I have completed the lab in full, per standards set in the manual.
>> I would have gotten a second opinion from a TA to ensure that this was the case,
>> but, unfortunately, all lab sections I attended were completely filled...

1.) Summary:

>> To summarize, this lab was a culmination of all previously-learned concepts applied to what
>> we now know about Finite State Machines. The toaster oven was a guise for a broader exploration
>> of how to properly operate ISR's, interact and handle event flags, cleanly utilize switch statements,
>> bitmasks, macro functions, and much more. There is a lot to uncover within this single assignment,
>> and much to be learned. At the point that we setup the software for our ovens, the rest is simply
>> hardware implementation--not so difficult after making everything else function. From my own
>> perspective, the hardest portion of the lab was formatting everything, ensuring that I hadn't
>> missed any parts to the functionality fo the system. It was hard to keep track of certain parts.

2.) Approach:

>> My approach to this lab was quite interesting, but effective, none-the-less.
>> I had to attend my brother's graduation last weekend, so time was an issue for me.
>> Instead of procrastinating until the Sunday that I would have returned, I decided to
>> work on it during the seven hour car ride there and back. Of course, I started
>> by reading the entire lab manual: after grasping what was required of me and how
>> to accomplish it, I set off to finish the preliminary skeleton of my code.
>> I ended the trip up north with a decent amount completed. Then, on the way back,
>> I began to transform my pseudo-code into an actually-functioning program.
>> Once I returned home, I started the debugging process: this took quite some
>> time because some files were missing in the provided Lab7.zip. After figuring
>> all of these things out, I implemented the extra credit as well as changed
>> any undesired features from my code.

3.) Results:

>> In short, this lab was pretty fantastic. I believe that I learned a lot, although
>> I truly wish that I had more time to make my code look prettier or more elegant.
>> The lab probably took no more than ten hours in total; most of it was spent
>> figuring out what I actually needed to do by reading the lab manual, checking
>> header files and comments within the code snippets provided. As for areas in which
>> the lab itself could improve, I would make the requirements less vague. For example,
>> the extra credit only specifies to have the screen invert repeatedly after exiting
>> the COOKING state, which could be interpreted in many ways. Another issue that
>> crept up on me was probably not so much to do with the lab manual, but moreso with
>> the provided equipment. My ADC and buttons (hardware) are strange, and go past
>> the default value with the potentiometer. Therefore, my displayed values also 
>> have a different range. I'm sure this won't effect the grading, but it can be annoying.
