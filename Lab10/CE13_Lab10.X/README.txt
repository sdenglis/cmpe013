1.) Collaboration:
>> Collaboration: NONE

2.) Summary:

>> This lab, albeit very short, was intensive. We had to recall the methods of file manipulation,
>> reading binary data from a .txt and importing it into our code, handling different bytes and
>> strings, sorting everything into its respective array. Then, after the functions take care of 
>> parsing the incoming data, it splits up everything into different chunks, allowing the programmer
>> to send the title and description of each room to the user. After all is said and done, the program
>> still needs to respond to the user's input (N , E, S, W, &Q), and change rooms accordingly.
>> I'm still not entirely sure if the makefile is supposed to be super complicated; if it was/is, 
>> then the lab manual did a poor job of conveying what was required/needed. As for the function
>> libraries, most were fairly straight-forward, but there was, in my opinion, still a lot of vagueness.

3.) Approach:

>> Well, to be honest, I didn't really have a legitimate approach to this lab. I've had other finals and
>> projects to work on/study for, I really had no time to start this last coding project until today, Wed.
>> I would have been happy to finish this and learn everything there is to learn about I/O handling and
>> file manipulation, but having it due the week of finals was brutal for me. Anyways, I read through the 
>> entire lab manual twice, and then set off to finish the libraries in Game.c and Player.c. The latter
>> was super simple; the former, Game.c, I feel needed a bit more explanation as to what functions are
>> useful in what situtation (I had forgotten about fopen(), fgetc(), fseek(), etc.), how to deal with 
>> each function via. more detailed headers. I ended up finishing all of the code for each library,
>> the main file as well as the makefile: all in all, things didn't turn out so badly. However, I definitely
>> would have vouched for more time in order to finish this assignemnt given the circumstances of this week.
>> I understand that the school doesn't allow any submissions past Thursday, but still...

4.) Results:

>> I really didn't have enough time to thouroughly test everything possbile. It didn't take that much time
>> to complete what I did, which is unfortunate: I could have totally finished everything completely
>> if would have alloted myself more time to work on this project. From what I have done, and from
>> what I have managed to learn, I still believe that this lab was fantastic and highly informative.
>> Again, all of the concepts which we learn about within each of our projects is priceless. Nobody can
>> ever take away our knowledge of pointers, makefiles, recursion, finite state machines, etc. We can
>> then build upon that foundation of ideas until it culminates into some greater vision of understanding.
>> Again, trying not to restate too much of what I've already mentioned, I feel that the lab manual
>> could have gone over Game.c in more detail. That's where I got stuck for quite a bit, and am still not
>> quite sure if everything is implemented correctly. At least, going through my code with logic, it 
>> seems to be sound, which counts for something I suppose. Next time around, I would just make this lab
>> optional, or have it incorporated into earlier labs so that this kind of workload during finals is
>> avoided. Although, thank y'all so much for making it weighted less and worth extra credit. I appreciate 
>> it. Furthermore, I thank the TA's, the instructor, everyone, for making this course so enjoyable.
